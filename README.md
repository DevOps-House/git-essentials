Hello All, Here I listed few things About Git!

What Is Git?
* Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files.
* It helps in coordinating work amongst several people in a project and tracks progress over time. Unlike the centralized version control system, Git branches can be easily merged. A new branch is created every time a developer wants to start working on something. 
* This ensures that the master branch always has a production-quality code.
* Git is a distributed version control system, so here, every developer gets their local repository with full commit history. 
* The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform diffs between commits.

So here is the basic commands of git
> git config
> git init
> git add
> git diff
> git commit
> git reset
> git status
> git merge
> git push
> git pull
> git checkout
> git branch
